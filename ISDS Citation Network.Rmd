# About this blog
This page documents the empirical analysis of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) citation network analysis. It is a part of my Ph.D. work. The work and the opinions are entirely my own. All rights reserved.

# I. Loading the data from GitHub
The data sets are available from my GitHub [here](https://github.com/chanyaaaa/WTO_ISDS_Precedent). There are two data sets for the analysis. First is the meta data which contains different attributes of ISDS disputes. The other is the adjacency matrix, containing a binary value that records a citation between any given pair of the disputes.
